# Blueprints

Documentation in: https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Guides/data/Handling%20calibration%20data/

Note: these blueprints define the sensors that will be loaded - ideally, the blueprint homogenises the data and then allows you to automatically pass it on to `metrics.

## About IDs

IDs that start with X in the blueprint, are not in the SC API but they are interesting for other APIs.
